## Development Process

### 1. 🔍 Before You Start

- Check if an issue already exists for your change
- For major changes, open an issue first to discuss
- Ensure your fork is up to date with the main branch

### 2. 🛠️ Making Changes

- Write clean, readable code
- Add/update tests as needed
- Update documentation if required
- Test your changes thoroughly

### 3. 📝 Committing

- Make small, focused commits
- Write clear commit messages (see below)
- Keep your branch up to date with main

## Style Guidelines

### Java Code Style

```java
// Use meaningful names
public class AudioPlayerService {  // Good
public class APS {                 // Bad

// Document public methods
/**
 * Plays the specified track.
 * 
 * @param track The track to play
 * @throws AudioException if playback fails
 */
public void playTrack(Song track) throws AudioException {
    // Implementation
}

// Use consistent formatting
if (condition) {
    doSomething();
} else {
    doSomethingElse();
}
```

### Key Guidelines

- **Indentation**: 4 spaces (no tabs)
- **Line length**: Max 120 characters
- **Naming**: 
  - Classes: `PascalCase`
  - Methods/variables: `camelCase`
  - Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- **JavaDoc**: Required for all public classes and methods
- **Imports**: No wildcard imports

### UI/UX Guidelines

- Keep the interface clean and intuitive
- Ensure keyboard navigation works
- Test with different screen sizes
- Follow existing design patterns

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash

mvn test jacoco:report
```

### Writing Tests

- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Maintain or improve code coverage
- Use meaningful test names
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)

```java
@Test
void shouldPlayNextTrackWhenCurrentEnds() {
    // Arrange
    Playlist playlist = createTestPlaylist();
    audioService.setPlaylist(playlist);
    
    // Act
    audioService.playTrack(playlist.getSongs().get(0));
    audioService.nextTrack();
    
    // Assert
    assertEquals(playlist.getSongs().get(1), audioService.getCurrentSong());
    assertTrue(audioService.isPlaying());
}
```
